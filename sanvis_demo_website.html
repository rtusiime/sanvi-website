    <h2>Pumpkin Cannoli Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese <br>
    1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree <br>
    1/2 cup confectioners' sugar <br>
    1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice <br>
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract <br>
    1/4 cup finely chopped nuts (pistachios or pecans work well) <br>
    12 premade cannoli shells</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    1. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, pumpkin puree, confectioners' sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract. <br>
    2. Mix with a rubber spatula until the filling is smooth. <br>
    3. Transfer the pumpkin filling into a piping bag fitted with a star or round tip. Alternatively, you can use a plastic bag with one corner snipped off. <br>
    4. Pipe the filling into each of the cannoli shells, filling them from both ends until they are full. <br>
    5. Sprinkle the finely chopped nuts over the filled ends of the cannoli. <br>
    6. Serve immediately to enjoy the crisp texture of the shells. <br>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    If you don't have a piping bag, a resealable plastic bag works just as well. Simply snip off one of the bottom corners after filling it. <br>
    For an extra touch, you can drizzle melted white or dark chocolate over the cannoli. <br>
    To keep the shells from getting soggy, fill them just before serving <br>
